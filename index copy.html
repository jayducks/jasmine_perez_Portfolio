        <p>I am studying Visual Communications at SFSU. I have lived in the bay area all my life in various cities. <br>
            I am currently living in Union City and have been for a little over a year now. My favorite and least favorite thing <br>
            about the bay is the transportation. The one thing I love about it is the food.<br>
            <p>I like to play piano, and paint. I also play the guitar and ukulele. Painting or reading are usually how I like to spend my free time<br>
             but I also play videogames if I can. I love to travel and collect masks from different countries.</p>

       <p> Hiro is an incredibly spoiled cat and takes up a decent amount of my time.<br>
        He even gets his own merch.
